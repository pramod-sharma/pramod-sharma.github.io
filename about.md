Hey Reader, this is Pramod's Blog for new technologies and product development
I am Ruby on Rails Developer with some domain knowledge of Windows Phone Development.

I am a keen learner for Big Data and IOT development. I loves to checkout latest Robotics development and buzzing startup ideas.
Other than my profession I loves to explore my hometown, their traditions and cultures.
